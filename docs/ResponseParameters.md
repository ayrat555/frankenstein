## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**migrate_to_chat_id** | Option<**i32**> | *Optional*. The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the specified identifier. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. | [optional]
**retry_after** | Option<**i32**> | *Optional*. In case of exceeding flood control, the number of seconds left to wait before the request can be repeated | [optional]
